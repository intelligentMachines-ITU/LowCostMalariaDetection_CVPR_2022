M5-Malaria Dataset (Multi-Microscope Multi-Magnification Malaria)  introduced in CVPR 2022 paper tited:  “Towards Low-Cost and Efficient Malaria Detection”

The shared folder consists of two sub-folders

* Images
* Annotations

Dataset consists of images obtained from multiple microscopes and at multiple resolutions. For ease of download,  each has been provided separately. Training, Validation and Testings splits are also provided. 

1. Images:
Images folder contains two folders, LCM and HCM. LCM contains images captured by Low Cost Microscope while HCM conatins images captured by Hight Cost Microscope. You will find images of the same region of thin blood smears across both LCM and HCM microscopes and along different magnifications(100x, 400x, 1000x) and the corresponding images have the same name. Dataset contains the XXX image and train/val/test folders contans XXX, YYY and ZZZ images respectively.

2. Annotations
This folder contains annotations for HCM and LCM both separately placed in their corresponding subfolders.

You will have the following content in the dataset:
